Welcome to the README of the MHClibrarys hours Github.

This document is here to hopefully help with running the hours signs smoothly. Look here for any information. If something is missing that should be here let the Librarys Technology Specialist know.

Uploading New ADS:
Ads for the library signs can be found in 2 places within the "images" folder.

For the outside hours sign, the portrait ads, the folder is "ads". Place any new ads in here. REQUIREMENT: Name them ad1.png - ad5.png. You MUST have 5 (they can be copies) and 5 is the max.
For the inside hours sign, the horizontal ads, the folder is "horizontal". Place any new ads in here. REQUIREMENT: Name them ad1.png - ad5.png. You MUST have 5 (they can be copies) and 5 is the max.

Dimensions for the ads: 

Feel free to use whatever if the poster is given to you from outside sources. For example, if Crave gives you a sign just use it whatever the dimensions are.

For the best look for posters follow these dimensions:

Portrait: 2376 px X 3669 px
Horizontal:
