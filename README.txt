Welcome to the README of the MHClibrarys hours Github.

This document is here to hopefully help with running the hours signs smoothly. Look here for any information. If something is missing that should be here let the Librarys Technology Specialist know.

Uploading New ADS:
Ads for the library signs can be found in 2 places within the "images" folder.

For the outside hours sign, the portrait ads, the folder is "ads". Place any new ads in here. REQUIREMENT: Name them ad1.png - ad5.png. You MUST have 5 (they can be copies) and 5 is the max.
For the inside hours sign, the horizontal ads, the folder is "horizontal". Place any new ads in here. REQUIREMENT: Name them ad1.png - ad5.png. You MUST have 5 (they can be copies) and 5 is the max.
Requirement: Ads must be in PNG format.

Dimensions for the ads: 

Feel free to use whatever if the poster is given to you from outside sources. For example, if Crave gives you a sign just use it whatever the dimensions are.

For the best look for posters follow these dimensions:
Portrait: 2376 px X 3669 px
Horizontal: 1850 X 1000

To publish the ads:
Once you are done replacing the images within the folder then you need to make the content live. Here are the steps.

Step 1: Open Github Desktop
On the left there will be a list of your changes.

Step 2: Give a summary (title) of the changes and click on "Commit to Master".

Step 3: Click on "Push Origin" on the top right of the client.

To see the immediate product go out to the Tv and refresh the website. Otherwise the Tv's website will refresh at some point.
